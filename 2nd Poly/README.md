# Programming Assignment - Polynomial

In this assignment, you will implement a polynomial and operations on it using a linked list.

## Rules

-  You will work on this assignment individually. Read the [DCS Academic Integrity Policy for Programming Assignments](http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/academics/undergraduate/academic-integrity-policy/programming-assignments) - you are responsible for abiding by the policy. In particular, note that "**All Violations of the Academic Integrity Policy will be reported by the instructor to the appropriate Dean**".

-  **IMPORTANT - READ THE FOLLOWING CAREFULLY!!!**

   Assignments emailed to the instructor or TAs will be ignored--they will NOT be accepted for grading.

   We will only grade submissions in Sakai.
   If your program does not compile, you will not get any credit.

   Most compilation errors occur for two reasons:

   1. You are programming outside Eclipse, and you delete the "package" statement at the top of the file. If you do this, you are changing the program structure, and it will not compile when we test it.
   2. You make some last minute changes, and submit without compiling.

   **To avoid these issues, (a) START EARLY, and give yourself plenty of time to work through the assignment, and (b) Submit a version well before the deadline so there is at least something in Autolab to grade.**

## Background

Read Section 3.1 in the textbook for background on polynomials and polynomial arithmetic.

A polynomial may be represented using a linked list as follows: for every term in the polynomial there is one entry in the linked list consisting of the term's coefficient and degree. The entries are ordered according to ASCENDING values of degree, i.e. lowest degree term first, then next lowest degree term and so on, all the way up to the highest degree term. IMPORTANT: Zero-coefficient terms are NOT stored.

For example, the following polynomial (the symbol `'^'` is used to mean 'raised to the power'):

```
4x^5 - 2x^3 + 2x +3
```

can be represented as the linked list of terms:

```
(3,0) -> (2,1) -> (-2,3) -> (4,5)
```

where each term is a (coefficient,degree) pair.

### Notes about representation

-  Terms are stored in ASCENDING order of degrees from front to rear in a non-circular linked list.
-  Zero-coefficient terms are NOT stored.
-  An EMPTY (zero) polynomial is represented by a linked list with NO NODES in it, i.e. referenced by `NULL`.
-  Coefficients are real numbers
-  Degrees are POSITIVE integers, except if there is a constant term, in which case the degree is zero.
-  There will not be more than one term in the same degree.

If you do not represent all your polynomials (the initial inputs as well as those you get out of doing arithmetic on polynomials) as above, you will lose credit even if your results are mathematically correct.

## Implementation and Grading

You will see a project called `Polynomial` with the following classes in package poly:

-  `Node`
-  `Term`
-  `Polynomial`
-  `Polytest`
   (Aside from these, there are also three sample input files, described in the [Running the Program](#running-the-program) section below.)

You need to complete the implementation of the `Polynomial` class where indicated in the following methods:

|   Method   | Grading Points |
| :--------: | :------------: |
| `evaluate` |       10       |
|   `add`    |       25       |
| `multiply` |       25       |

You may use [`Math`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/14/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Math.html) class methods as needed.

There is no formal requirement of efficiency for any of the methods. However, every test case run will be timed out after 3 seconds, which is plenty of time even for inefficient code. If your method is timed out on a test case you will get no credit for that test.

Note: You will get a zero if you use any other data structure (e.g. array/arraylist) anywhere in your implementation, for any reason, even if it has nothing to do with the actual polynomial operations. You must work with linked lists ONLY all the way through.

Do not change `Node` and `Term` in any way. You will not be submitting them, and we will be using the original versions to test your `Polynomial` implementation.
If you wish to change Polytest, feel free. You will not be submitting it, and we will not be using it to grade your `Polynomial` submission.

Observe the following rules while working on `Polynomial.java`:

-  Only fill in the code in the methods `add`, `multiply`, and evaluate where indicated.
-  In methods that return a `Polynomial` (`add` and `multiply`), the polynomial that is returned must be represented as described in the [Notes about representation](#notes-about-representation) part of the [Background](#background) section above.
-  Your method will not get credit if the returned polynomial does not adhere to this representation, even it is mathematically correct. Also see the [Notes about empty (zero) polynomials](#notes-about-empty-zero-polynomials) at the end of the [Running the program](#running-the-program) section below.
-  DO NOT remove the package line at the top of the file.
-  DO NOT remove any of the import statements.
-  DO NOT add any import statements.
-  DO NOT change the headers of ANY of the given methods
-  DO NOT change/remove any of the given class fields
-  DO NOT add any new class fields - this includes variables and classes.
-  YOU MAY add new helper methods, but you must declare them private.

Before you submit, make sure to check your code against the original [`Polynomial.java`](src/poly/Polynomial.java), [`Term.java`](src/poly/Term.java), and [`Node.java`](src/poly/Node.java) files to make sure you have adhered to the rules above.

## Running the program

There are three sample input files for you to test:

-  A file [`ptest1.txt`](ptest1.txt) that contains the polynomial

   ```
   4x^5 - 2x^3 + 2x + 3
   ```

-  A file [`ptest2.txt`](ptest2.txt) that contains the polynomial

   ```
   8x^4 + 4x^3 - 3x + 9
   ```

-  A file [`ptest1opp.txt`](ptest1opp.txt) that contains the polynomial

   ```
   -4x^5 + 2x^3 - 2x - 3
   ```

   (the negation of the polynomial in `ptest1`)

In each of these files, each line is a term, with the first value being the coefficient, and the second value being the degree. The terms are listed in **descending** order of degrees and the respective non-zero coefficients. Remember that when you store a polynomial in a linked list, you will store it in **ascending** order of degrees. (This is actually already implemented by the Polynomial constructor when it reads a polynomial from an input file. All you have to do is make sure you stick with this rule when you add and multiply.)

You may assume that we will NOT test with an invalid polynomial file, i.e. every test input file will either have at least one term in the correct format, or will be empty (see [Notes about empty (zero) polynomials](#notes-about-empty-zero-polynomials) below). So you don't need to check for validity of input.

Here's a sample run of the driver, `Polytest`. Apart from `ptest1.txt`, `ptest2.txt`, and `ptest1opp.txt`, a fourth test polynomial file, `ptestnull.txt` is also used. This is an empty file that stands for a `null` (zero) polynomial - you will need to create this yourself. See notes after the test run for special instructions regarding zero polynomials.

```
Enter the name of the polynomial file => ptest1.txt

4.0x^5 + -2.0x^3 + 2.0x + 3.0

3. EVALUATE polynomial
4. QUIT
        Enter choice # => 4
```

The sample tests we have given you are just for starters. You will need to create other tests of your own on which you can run your code. For every test you run, be careful to keep your test input in the same format as the test files provided, otherwise `Polytest` will not work correctly. And make sure your test file is in the same folder as the other files, i.e. under `Polynomial`.

### Note on translation from internal to output representation

The `toString` method in the `Polynomial` class returns a string with the terms in descending order, fit for printing. (It processes the ascending ordered terms of the input linked list in reverse order.) For illustration, see how the `add` method in `Polytest` prints the resulting polynomial:

```java
System.out.println("Sum: " + Polynomial.toString(Polynomial.add(poly1, poly2)) + "\n");
```

### Notes about empty (zero) polynomials

If you want to test with an empty polynomial input, you should create a file with nothing in it.

Remember that when you add two terms of the same degree, if you get a zero coefficient result term, it should not be added to the result polynomial. As listed in the "[Notes about representation](#notes-about-representation) in the [Background](#background) section, zero-coefficient terms are not stored.

The string representation of a zero polynomial is `"0"` - see the `toString` method of the `Polynomial` class. So, the `Polytest` driver will print a zero for a zero polyomial input, or a zero polynomial that results from an operation performed on two polynomials.

## Submission

Submit your `Polynomial.java` source file.

## Grading Process

-  Your code will be auto-graded by a grading program (grader), that will run several test cases on each of `evaluate`, `add`, and `multiply`.
-  We will not accept requests to grade any other submission other than the latest submission.
-  For each test case, the result computed by your code will be compared with that computed by our correct code. Each test case is a unit of partial credit, so credits for a method are accumulated one test case at a time. There is no partial credit within a test case: either your program works on a test case (full credit for that test case), or it doesn't (no credit for that test case.)

   Note that for the `add` `and` `multiply` methods, the auto-grader will examine the resulting linked list, NOT printed output. (The auto-grader does NOT use `Polytest` at all - that is just for your use.) In other words, the grading script will compare the linked list structure of the correct result with the linked list structure in your implementation. For `evaluate`, the returned float value will be checked.

   If you call the `add` method in your `multiply` implementation, be aware that if your `add` implementation does not work correctly, your `multiply` method's correctness will be adversely impacted as well, and you will lose credit for it as well for the failed test cases.

-  All printed output will be ignored. This also means if you threw in print statements for debugging and left them in your code, they will have no bearing on the grading.
-  After the second and final grading run, the test cases used by the grader will be posted so you can run your program against them to verify the grade report. Remember, verification means checking the **in-memory contents** of the linked list for `add` and `multiply`, and the return value of evaluate -- NOT what your program might print to output.
